                Introduction and Context
            </h2>
            
            
            <p>	The idea of ZenPet is conceived in response to the fast-paced, goal-driven, and comparison-based zeitgeist of the information age. Many people seem to always be on the move for the next best thing in life, leaving no room for retrospection and reflection. Social media platforms only exacerbate this issue by fostering comparison and superficiality. With ZenPet, I attempt to reorient people’s energy in the information from outward to inward, turning redundant outward expression into much-needed self-reflection, turning soul-consuming comparison into nourishing care.

                <p class="py-2" style=" font-size: 1.1rem">Currently, the main tool for self-reflection is journaling. People who journal often write down their thoughts and feelings to better process and understand them. It is widely acclaimed as a practice that encourages mental health, personal development, and intentional living. 
                    <strong>Exploring ways to improve this current practice, I conducted interviews with five of my classmates.</strong>

                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">To achieve the aforementioned goals, the idea was to elevate the reflective aspect of journaling with a fun mechanism or object. Tamagotchi is a digital pet developed by Bandai that took children all over the world by storm in the 1990s. People form deep emotional connections with the device for its cuteness and appeal to human nurture instincts.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">However, our team reckons that under today’s technological context, <strong>there is a lot of room for innovation for the product to make the emotional connection deeper and more sincere.</strong> </p>

                        <li>The current mechanism of fulfilling the pet’s need is achieved by only clicks of buttons or mini-games. <u>A lot of emotional depth can be added to the process.</u> </li>
                        <li>The care element of the device is very rich. For our design, we will attempt to <u>channel that energy of care toward the pet to the users themselves.</u> </li>
                        <li>Outside of the game mechanism, we will explore how <u>form factors</u> can be modified and augmented to <u>catalyze the formation of deep emotional connections.</u></li>

            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem" >These are all great apps that capture one or two areas of being fun, building organic habits, encouraging reflection, and forming emotional connections. <strong>However, none of them can achieve four areas altogether.</strong></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">In addition, none of the apps aim to capture the more nuanced human experience and inner world, changing the way people view their experiences. We aim to fill that gap and create a product that captures all of the four aforementioned areas, which is novel in the market and greatly helpful to people’s spiritual lives.</p>

                <h3>Case Implementation</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">After conceptualizing, our team dove into the prototyping process. At this point, <strong>We have to deal with real-life problems and make compromises. </strong> At this stage, we have to find ways to encase a Raspberry Pi 3, a power bank, and a 4-inch touch screen and organize various wires. Thus, we have to think realistically to work with our hardware. Though we made compromises due to time and hardware constraints, we retained our original design goal and philosophy.	</p>

                What I Learned
            </h2>
            <ol style="font-weight:200" class="py-3">
                <li><strong>Being a great leader is not easy.</strong> In this project, being a product lead poses many exciting challenges for me. Though it is rocky at times, I learned to be a good leader that can set clear goals, think ahead, construct effective timelines, and hold the team accountable.
                </li>
                <li><strong>In the product cycle, the things least expected will take the longest time.</strong> During the entire design process, we thought that major procedures like ideation, artwork, and game development would take the most time and energy. However, it was the nuanced things like getting the game running on the Pi and linking the camera to the device browser. I learned to not take these seemingly straightforward procedures lightly and develop better plans that take those into consideration.</li>
                <li><strong>Successful product comes from pushing limits.</strong> this project, my team and I really pushed ourselves out of our comfort zone to achieve success. Personally, I learned game development on Unity, CAD on Fusion360, and compositing sprite animations. Exploring uncharted areas proves to be not only inevitable to create a successful product, but also exciting for me to grow my toolkit.</li>
